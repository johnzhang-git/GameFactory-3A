operators/gen_3d_scene/funcs/terrain_code_template/landforms.py

The ground, one function per landform.

Each returns a `Ground`: the terrain itself plus the few measurements the
foreground needs to place anything sensibly on it. Those measurements have to
come from here because they are properties of the shape — where a basin
actually bottoms out, what level a street network was graded to, where two
roads cross. Re-deriving them in the foreground would mean two answers to the
same question.

Nothing here places a prop. A landform returns ground and facts about ground;
`foreground.py` decides what stands on it.

Three things are done to nearly every landform before it is handed on, and
they are what separate one from a noise field:

    warped noise    every relief shape reads `warped_noise`, so slopes run
                    and hollows are not circles
    terracing       worked ground is folded into treads, which is both what
                    a farmed or built-on hillside looks like and what gives
                    a greybox slope a set of lines to be read against — and
                    what anything standing on it has to stand on
    baking          the height is sampled onto the grid the surface is
                    written from, so what the foreground measures and what
                    `check_scene` validates is the ground the GLB carries
                    rather than a formula the exported mesh only samples
